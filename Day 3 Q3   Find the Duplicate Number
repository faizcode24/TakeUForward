Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

Basic approach is the we can count to find it and then we will sort it and i+1 will be the answer

The  Main approach is that we wil use the LINKED LIST CYCLE METHOD TC will be O(1)

class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
            int start = nums[0];
        int end = nums[0];

        do{
            start= nums[start];
            end = nums[nums[end]];
        }
        while ( start != end);

        start = nums[0];

        while(start != end){
            start= nums[start];
            end=nums[end];
        }

        return end;

        
    }
}
