 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

we neet to but the stock such that it has to give the maximum profit
so we will buy the stock at the minimum value and sell it at the highest price
buy at 1 and will sell at 6


class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxprofit=0;
        int buy= prices[0];
        for(int i =0; i < prices.length; i++){
            buy = Math.min(buy,prices[i]);
            int profit = prices[i] - buy;
            maxprofit= Math.max(maxprofit,profit);
        }
        return maxprofit;
        
    }
}
